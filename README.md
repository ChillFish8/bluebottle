# Bluebottle

_A delightfully tasteful Jellyfin and local media desktop client._

The goal is to have a great looking UI for managing your media without a webview, this is because on my
system, I don't know why, but the stock Jellyfin client runs terribly and just feels bad to use.

So with that in mind, I created Bluebottle with the following goals:

- Native only, no webview.
- A clean and intuitive to navigate.
- Local media support, not just Jellyfin.
- Designed with horizontal _and_ vertical monitor layouts in mind.
